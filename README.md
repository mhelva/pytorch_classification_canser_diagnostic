# Breast Cancer Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a binary classification task using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and PyTorch. The goal is to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on various input features.

## Dataset

The [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) is used in this project. It was accessed via the `ucimlrepo` Python library.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`
- Neural network built with `PyTorch`
- Model training, validation, and evaluation
- Visualization with `matplotlib`

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `torch`
- `ucimlrepo`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torch ucimlrepo
